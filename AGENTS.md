# Agent Instructions

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Requirements for new apps
- Every new app added to this repository must expose a clearly visible control that toggles the app into and out of full-screen mode.
- The full-screen experience must function correctly on desktop browsers as well as mobile browsers on phones and iPads. Test or design your implementation with responsive layouts in mind.
- Whenever practical, include a button or other obvious control within each new app that links users back to the repository's main landing page.
